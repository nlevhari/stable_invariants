## Introduction

The **Stable Primitivity Rank Calculator** is a tool that calculates algebraic invariants of words in free groups, specifically the stable primitivity rank (\( \text{s}\pi^{(m)}(w) \)) and its variants. These invariants are significant in various fields of mathematics, including algebra, topology, and combinatorics.

This program allows you to:

- Compute the stable primitivity rank for individual words.
- Run statistical analyses over many words of specified lengths.
- Explore concepts in free group theory without needing to delve into complex computations manually.

## Understanding the Concepts

### Free Groups and Words

A **free group** is a group where every element (word) is a combination of generators and their inverses without any relations other than the group axioms. For example, in a free group of rank 2, you have generators \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \).

### Stable Primitivity Rank

The **stable primitivity rank** (\( \text{s}\pi^{(m)}(w) \)) of a word \( w \) measures how "non-primitive" \( w \) is within the free group, considering coverings and subgroups. It's a refined concept that captures deeper algebraic properties of the word.

---

## Examples

### Single Word Calculation

- **Problem**: Compute \( \text{s}\pi^{(m)}(w) \) for \( w = a_1 a_2^{-1} a_1 \) in a free group of rank 2.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the program.
  2. Select **Single Word Calculation**.
  3. Set **Problem Type** to `Stable Primitivity Rank`.
  4. Enter **Rank (r)**: `2`.
  5. Enter **Word**: `1 -2 1`.
  6. Click **Calculate**.
- **Result**: The program displays the stable primitivity rank.

### Statistical Analysis

- **Problem**: Analyze words of lengths 5 to 10 in a free group of rank 2.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the program.
  2. Select **Statistical Analysis**.
  3. Set **Problem Type** to `Stable Primitivity Rank`.
  4. Enter **Rank (r)**: `2`.
  5. Set **Minimum Length**: `5`.
  6. Set **Maximum Length**: `10`.
  7. Set **Samples per Length**: `100`.
  8. Click **Run Analysis**.
- **Result**: The program displays a summary of the mean and standard deviation of \( \text{s}\pi^{(m)}(w) \) for each word length.
